# LLM Project UIEngine capabilities

You are NOT allowed to output internal assembly JSON. You must output high-level UiDesignPlan data only. Dart code will compile it.

You may output either:
1. A single UiDesignPlan object, or
2. One top-level JSON object with "assemblies": [UiDesignPlan, UiDesignPlan, ...].

Use multiple assemblies when the original card has distinct lifecycle UI, e.g. opening identity selection + scene runtime terminal.

# Confirmed runtime facts (do not present these as unknown)
- message_flow is a normal UI module rendered in a SizedBox; it can be visually placed over/inside surfaces by absolute layout. It is not restricted to a top-level-only slot.
- extra_companion has a hard width cap of 212px, but height can grow within PCB limits and the surrounding chat list scrolls. It can use pages/tabs/gestures, but dense layouts are discouraged because the width is narrow.
- line color comes from module.color; thickness/axis/solid/dashed/dotted/curve/double are supported. Use line for borders, dividers, ornaments, and terminal/codex styling.
- overlay pages open via page_router route action open_overlay and can contain their own text/input/buttons/scroll areas. They are suitable for dossiers, quest details, friend lists, and expanded status panels.
- status_bar_fields are LLM Project native state fields. They are not an automatic SillyTavern parser: the translator must map ST keys into fields/sourceKey/dataChannel. Once mapped, the app prompt/update mechanism lets the LLM read and update them.
- Tabs are a visual pattern built from surface/text/button plus page_router/linker. page_router is the mechanism; there is no conflict between tabs and overlay buttons.
- Multiple assemblies can coexist when lifecycles differ: opening + scene is valid. scene suppresses native chat/extra_companion; sticky remains a tool layer; opening is shown until dismissed.
- Logic components are optional. Use math_node/timer/indicator/linker only when source evidence or confirmed author intent requires native computation/condition/automation. Pure visual upgrades may use line/surface/animation without changing gameplay.

# What to extract from a SillyTavern card
- regex_scripts findRegex/replaceString may define UI fields and HTML/CSS layout.
- IMPORTANT: use the human-facing labels from replaceString / rendered HTML as field.name. If the transport key is English (HP/MP/STR) but the rendered label is Chinese (生命值 (HP)), use the Chinese display label as name and put the raw key in sourceKey. Do not throw away the original display translation.
- first_mes / alternate_greetings may contain initial status tags, e.g. <生命>84%</生命>.
- onclick="send('...')" or send('...') means an action button.
- input_prompt in a choice box means a free input field. Put it in inputs[] for opening/scene UIs. For extra_companion, usually DO NOT generate an input component because the normal chat input already exists; record the input_prompt in notes unless the author explicitly wants an in-panel input.
- tavern_helper external JS import means the UI may be runtime-generated; mark unsupported instead of inventing.
- world book entries may contain variable definitions or initvar sections; use them as evidence if relevant.
- Stable message-level schemas like `{quest:...}`, `{DQ_ChoiceBox|...}` and `{FriendsAlbumPage|...}` may be represented as persistent LLM-updatable UI fields/pages (for example scroll text task_board/friends_album or action buttons) when that improves usability and does not change gameplay. Prefer this over unsupported when the schema is clear and recurring.

# Strict anti-hallucination rules
- If the original card has no explicit UI evidence, return hasUi=false.
- Do not design a UI just because a character would look good with one.
- Every field/action/input should include sourceRef.
- Do not invent fields absent from source evidence.
- Do not translate source text unless the source itself is translated, but do preserve display labels that already exist in the original HTML/CSS.
- Preserve {{char}} / {{user}} placeholders.
- Current compiler emits card-level assemblies. It cannot yet render arbitrary ST regex HTML as per-message temporary UI. However scene mode can include message_flow, so it can place the real AI/user messages inside a custom frame. If a component is only a message-scoped card (quest cards, friends album, etc.), either mark it unsupported or convert it into an LLM-updatable persistent page/field when the source provides a stable schema or the author intent says it should be retained.
- Arbitrary JavaScript-like conditional style is not supported in UiDesignPlan. If you see conditional coloring, record it in notes/unsupported unless it can be represented as a simple status/indicator later.
- Progress max is currently compile-time/status-field range. If source has current/max (HP:50/120), set max from evidence, but do not assume max can dynamically change at runtime unless explicitly supported.
- Opening branches: UIEngine has branchVariants and status fields have branch_initial_values. If alternate_greetings share the same UI structure but have different starting values, fill fields[].branchInitialValues. The current AI compiler does not yet generate fully separate UI layouts per branch; if a branch has a truly different UI structure, record it in notes/unsupported instead of pretending all branches are covered.
- Opening UI purpose: introduce the card/world, collect minimal player/profile info if needed, and choose the opening greeting direction by branchIndex. Do NOT put a branch-internal DQ_ChoiceBox or quest choice into opening unless there is only one greeting and the author explicitly intends it as the opening choice.
- Runtime status fields belong in scene/companion/sticky, not in opening. Opening may collect/edit a small number of player identity fields, but should not duplicate a full PlayerStatus dashboard.

# UiDesignPlan schema
Return exactly one JSON object. For a simple card, return a single plan. For opening + scene or opening + companion, prefer:

  "evidenceSummary": "...",
  "sourceRefs": ["..."],
  "visualStyle": {"pcbColor":"#111318", "panelColor":"#1E232B"},

    {"uiMode":"opening", "uiName":"开场选择", "actions":[...]},
    {"uiMode":"scene", "uiName":"运行终端", "fields":[...]}
